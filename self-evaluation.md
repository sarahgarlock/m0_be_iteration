# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
I feel confident about it, the theory of .each makes sense.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
No struggle here, I enjoyed seeing everything come together.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I think I need to be better about note taking and reviewing those notes. I understand everything in the moment but I tend to feel a little foggy the next day. 
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
None right now, let's do more!
